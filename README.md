Duplicate Code Detector (dcd)
-----------------------------

A tool similar to simian http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian/ which is designed to identify duplicate code inside a project.
It is however open source.

### Install

#### Go Get

If you are comfortable using Go and have >= 1.19 installed:

```shell
go install github.com/boyter/dcd@latest
```

#### Manual

Binaries for GNU/Linux and macOS for both i386 and x86_64 and ARM64 machines are available from the [releases](https://github.com/boyter/dcd/releases) page.

### Pitch

Why use `dcd`?

- It's reasonably fast and works with large projects 
- Works very well across multiple platforms without slowdown (GNU/Linux, macOS)

### Usage

Command line usage of `dcd` is designed to be as simple as possible.
Full details can be found in `dcd --help` or `dcd -h`. Note that the below reflects the state of master not a release.

```
$ dcd -h
dcd
Version 1.1.0
Ben Boyter <ben@boyter.org>

Usage:
  dcd [flags]

Flags:
  -x, --exclude-pattern strings   file and directory locations matching case sensitive patterns will be ignored [comma separated list: e.g. vendor,_test.go]
  -f, --fuzz uint8                fuzzy value where higher numbers allow increasingly fuzzy lines to match, values 0-255 where 0 indicates exact match
  -h, --help                      help for dcd
  -i, --include-ext strings       limit to file extensions [comma separated list: e.g. go,java,js]
  -m, --match-length int          min match length (default 6)
      --max-read-size-bytes int   number of bytes to read into a file with the remaining content ignored (default 10000000)
      --min-line-length int       number of bytes per average line for file to be considered minified (default 255)
      --no-gitignore              disables .gitignore file logic
      --no-ignore                 disables .ignore file logic
      --process-same-file         
  -v, --verbose                   verbose output
      --version                   version for dcd

```

Output should look something like the below for any project

```
$ dcd

 lines 0-8 match 0-8 in processor/workers_tokei_test.go (length 8)

Note that you don't have to specify the directory you want to run against. Running `dcd` will assume you want to 
run against the current directory.

### Ignore Files

`dcd` mostly supports .ignore files inside directories that it scans. This is similar to how ripgrep, ag and tokei work. 
.ignore files are 100% the same as .gitignore files with the same syntax, and as such `dcd` will ignore files and directories
listed in them. You can add .ignore files to ignore things like vendored dependency checked in files and such. 
The idea is allowing you to add a file or folder to git and have ignored in the count.

### Development

If you want to hack away feel free! PR's are generally accepted.
